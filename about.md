I have spent most of my professional career as a science educator and leader.  I loved watching young faces become intrigued when seeing a new phenomena or observing confidence grow after completing a rigorous project.   In my as an educator, I always sought out new challenges teaching all disciplines of science, overhauling the AP Physics program at Denver South High, and seeking out leadership opportunities.  I spent a number of summers as a teacher research intern at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory working with Dr. Melvin Tucker analyzing biomass for ethanol production.  With the drive to seek out new challenges, I wanted to merge my communication and collaboration skills built through science instruction and school leadership with my passion for analysis and problem solving. 

The avenue to accomplish presented itself four years ago when I was introduced to computer programming and the power of data science/analytics by some of my students in our STEM club.  Since that time the subject has been a hobby of mine.  Through the pandemic, I have waited for an opportunity to advance this hobby into a career with the right in-person school.  When I found the BrainStation Data Science Diploma Online Bootcamp, I knew I had found the best alternative to an in-person program.  Fast forward to December 2022, I have graduated from BrainStation with an ever growing expertise in data science/analytics.

The course required long hours, maximum effort, and fast-paced deadlines, but the experience was just as fun and rewarding.  I never thought I could forge such strong bonds through a computer screen. 

Some of the projects  that I completed to earn the diploma included:
- an investigation modeling West Nile Virus prevalence in the Chicago metro area
- an analysis of Bixi Bike Rental traffic in the Montreal metro area
- the development of a more accessible Google Alerts web service
- a sentiment analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to classify hotel reviews 
- a data wrangling endeavor to visualize a large dataset from Google Books Ngram
- the production of predictive models to forecast wind power from an EDP Renewables wind farm. 

I am still building on this expertise as an analyst working to improve my models on wind power forecasting and refining past projects.  I have also joined a team to tackle this year’s Women in Data Science(WiDS) “Datathon Challenge - Adapting to Climate Change by Improving Extreme Weather Forecasts.”
